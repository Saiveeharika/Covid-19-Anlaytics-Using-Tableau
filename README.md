This Tableau dashboard offers an in-depth analysis of Covid-19 in India, showcasing visualizations like a map of total deaths by state, a pie chart for age group distribution, and a line chart tracking case trends over time. It includes bar charts for ICMR testing labs per state, a comparison of first and second vaccination doses, and statewise testing details. A donut chart displays gender distribution, while the line chart shows confirmed, cured, and death cases from early spring to late summer across two years. The data is drawn from public Covid-19 datasets, including government and ICMR sources, with Mapbox used for geographical mapping. Users can interact with the dashboard to filter and explore the data further.
